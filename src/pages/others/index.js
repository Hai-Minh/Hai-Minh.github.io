                                        To find the inspiration for a new role as well as to please her husband, Hương - the author of the movie has applied to work as a telemarketing employee for a sleeping pill company. Ironically, on the first day of work, Huong was unfairly slapped by her colleague Nhài. The slap is like the clap on the movie set, leaving a resounding echo in Huong as well as a rhythm for a series of dramatic changes that happen continuously throughout her day.

                                        Inspired by the esthetic of painter Nguyen Gia Tri lacquer painting and the story in the banana trees in Nguyen Tuan novel “Echo and Shadow Upon a Time” (Vang Bong Mot Thoi)." Seven dancers are performing between the banana trees in a Butoh manner. They will blend in to be a part of nature, like wandering souls or just like the dried banana leaves in the garden. You can hear cutting pieces of a sonar, silent, than the sound of the banana forest.
