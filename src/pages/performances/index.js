Instead of showing all philosophical layers of the original play, "{<WordAWoman />}" focuses on looking deeper into Antigone's inner world and through this woman's journey to find the answer for the question: What can a human do when fate has been arranged? Even if it is a tragedy, how will a person proceed in the journey to her own foreknown death?
