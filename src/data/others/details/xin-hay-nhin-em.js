    To find the inspiration for a new role as well as to please her husband, Hương - the author of the movie has applied to work as a telemarketing employee for a sleeping pill company. Ironically, on the first day of work, Huong was unfairly slapped by her colleague Nhài. The slap is like the clap on the movie set, leaving a resounding echo in Huong as well as a rhythm for a series of dramatic changes that happen continuously throughout her day.
