    Inspired by the esthetic of painter Nguyen Gia Tri lacquer painting and the story in the banana trees in Nguyen Tuan novel “Echo and Shadow Upon a Time” (Vang Bong Mot Thoi)." Seven dancers are performing between the banana trees in a Butoh manner. They will blend in to be a part of nature, like wandering souls or just like the dried banana leaves in the garden. You can hear cutting pieces of a sonar, silent, than the sound of the banana forest.

    "I would like to create a lacquer painting by language of moving images. By using different elements of culture, to combine and destroy them to think about how traditional or contemporary patterns of culture have been formed." - Quynh Dong
