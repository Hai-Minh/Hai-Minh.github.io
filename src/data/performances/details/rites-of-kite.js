    {`“Rites of kite“ - a recent multidisciplinary performance at the Peace Park in Hanoi conveived by Siedl/Cao, with poem recital, movement & music composition by Siedl/Cao and dance performance by choreographer Minh Hai @haiminhchan. Rites of kite is a contemplation about kite-flying, a tradition that is endangered by the sprawling urbanisation, a practice or even a ritual that connects the ancestors and the modern people, the nature and the human-being.`}
  </p>
  <p>
    {`The deliberate use of traditional Vietnamese style of reciting poetry stands in contrast with the modern landscape, dotted with high-rise buildings, in a park bordered by 8-lanes highways. The minimalistic music composed by Siedl/Cao combined with ritualistic choreography of intentionally slow movements created an atmosphere with slower inner time feeling - a juxtaposition with the fast-paced modern life.`}
