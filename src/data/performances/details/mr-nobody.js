The performance is the expression of sympathy besides an effort to share about injustices or power imbalances in many countries nowadays. Some people have lost their speech, some people have lost their right, some people simply cannot have a “normal” life!
You are invited to come, to see, to feel and to breathe with the atmosphere of “Mr Nobody” that Hai was trying to create, with earnestness and care.
