        “Dear all the organizers of the workshop “Release and connect”,<br /> 
        It’s been a long time since I’ve had a suitable space to relax and move freely. I feel very comfortable with the space and with the activities that you designed in today’s session. I also find my classmates very cute, and relized that everyone needs more love and care. After relaxing with many movements, I have somewhat connected with the things deep in my soul. I am also calmer and more peaceful than before. I think I want to come more times to relax and connect more.<br />
        Thanks everyone“ – Dung
