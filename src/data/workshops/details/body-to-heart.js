    <p>
      There are countless bodily realities, each accompanied by unique ways of
      perceiving and interacting with the world. People with disabilities
      experience and connect with the world differently from those without
      disabilities.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Moving together and allowing these bodily realities to meet is an
      opportunity to explore how each person lives, breathes, and interacts with
      the world. It is also a way for us to share our stories and discover
      connections with others. A gentle touch or a moment of resonance between
      seemingly opposing differences can help us reflect on ourselves, deepen
      our understanding, and appreciate the beauty of diversity amidst the
      constant rush of life.
