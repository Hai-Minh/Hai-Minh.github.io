        “The feeling after three days of attending the workshop is that the workshop is very comfortable and light. Hai loves what she’s doing, her love for her job and love for dance is contagious to students. Although it was short, the workshop instilled in me a love of movement. Hope to join Hai’s other workshops.

        Thank you for loving dance and spreading dance to everyone. Watching someone move also feels a certain part of personality. Sometimes even reading is more than normal communication. Thanks very much”
